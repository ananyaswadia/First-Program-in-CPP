To write a Hello World and a calculator program.

##  Theory

### 1. **Hello World Program**
The Hello World program is typically the first program written when learning a new programming language. Its purpose is to familiarize the programmer with the basic syntax, structure, and compilation process.

**Key Concepts:**
- `#include <iostream>` – Includes the standard input/output stream library.
- `std::cout` – Used to output text to the console.
- `return 0;` – Indicates that the program ended successfully.

  
 2. **Mathematical Operations on Two Numbers**

This program takes two numerical inputs from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations:
- **Addition (+)**
- **Subtraction (-)**
- **Multiplication (*)**
- **Division (/)**

**Key Concepts:**
- Input/output handling using `cin` and `cout`.
- Use of arithmetic operators in C++.
- Basic control flow and structure.
- Type handling (e.g., avoiding division by zero).
